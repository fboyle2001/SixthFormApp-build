			<button class="collapsible">Preparation</button>
			<div class="content2">
			  <p>Start early – There is a set amount of content that you need to learn. The earlier that you start revising the more time that you have to learn it all meaning that you can relax and work at a slower pace as you have plenty of time. </p>
			  <p>Make a revision timetable – Research has found that short sessions of revision (20-30 minutes) tend to work best due to your concentration levels being higher. The idea is to do a shorter session of study followed by a five to ten-minute break then another session. </p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Remove distractions</button>
			<div class="content2">
			  <p>Put the phone down – While studying you need as few distractions as possible because most things are more interesting than studying so if you notice a distraction like a new message coming in then you are likely to want to check it rather than doing the work. Try and leave your phone turned off and well out of arms reach so it does not distract you.</p>
			  <p>Find a quiet space – A quiet space with no distractions is important when studying. As mentioned in the tip above distractions can stop your concentration and ultimately waste your time. Having a quiet space will greatly reduce the amount of distractions that you face and allow you to get more done. </p>			  
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Tips for notes</button>
			<div class="content2">
			  <p>Summarise information – Exams tend to contain a lot of content for you to learn so by summarising the information you make the amount of information needed to remember less so it becomes easier for you. The summary should contain only the important information and that’s the stuff that you want to remember. </p>
			  <p>Try using colour when creating notes – This will not work for everyone but it is a good idea to try and include this into your notes. This will help to make the notes more interesting to write and more interesting to read. If the notes are more interesting, then you will be able to take more of the information in. </p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Revision techniques</button>
			<div class="content2">
			  <p>Do past papers – Working on notes is good but at the end of it all you will have to sit an exam. Sitting an exam and answering questions in an exam format is its own skill and it must be developed too. If not, then you will know a lot of the information but will be answering the questions in the wrong way therefore losing marks that you knew the content for. Past papers can be found by going on to the website of the exam board and downloading one.  </p>
			  <p>Create revision materials – Things like flash cards can help to memorise key points whereas mind maps can show more detail in a more visual way. Everyone is different so every learns in a different way. This means that you can try several different ways and see what works for you. </p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Revision productivity tips</button>
			<div class="content2">
			  <p>Exercise – Physical activity is very important for our physical and mental wellbeing. Exercise causes our heart rate to increase so the blood can circulate faster meaning that the brain can get more oxygen. If the brain has more oxygen, then productivity levels increase and stress levels decrease.</p>
			  <p>Reward yourself – After your revision session has ended it is important to give yourself a reward of some kind as you have done well. Before you start your revision session, choose something that you enjoy. This could be playing a video game, drawing or watching Netflix. Anything that you would be happy to spend your time doing and tell yourself that after the revision you will be doing this activity. This will act as motivation to do the work so you can do the thing that you enjoy. It will also ensure that you don’t spend your whole day doing something that you do not enjoy.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Positivity</button>
			<div class="content2">
			  <p>Think positively – Exams are important but they are not the end of the world. If you do not end up with the result that you hoped for then that does not make you a failure. </p>
			  <p>Bill Gates once said – “I failed my exam in some subjects but my friend passed. Now he is an engineer at Microsoft and I am the owner.” You can go on to do great things with your life! Happy revising!</p>

			<button class="collapsible">Stress</button>
			<div class="content2">
			  <p>Stress is an emotion that many feel going through school (especially near exam season). Stress in small amounts can be good for us as it can boost performance in these situations but the problem arises when stress starts to overwhelm us. Unfortunately, stress is becoming increasingly common in people, in the past year, 74% of people have felt so stressed they have been overwhelmed or unable to cope. In addition to this 51% of adults who felt stressed reported feeling depressed, and 61% reported feeling anxious. This shows that extreme stress can have a knock on effect and tie in to other mental disorders.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">How to identify stress</button>
			<div class="content2">
			
			
			
			
			  <p>How to identify stress:<br>The first step in solving a problem is to identify it. Below are some phrases, grab a pen and paper and work down the list. If you agree with a statement then write that down on some paper and if you disagree with a statement then write that down on the paper. At the end you can review you score and see how stressed you are. Alternatively at the bottom of section there will be a more comprehensive test for stress as the one provided is a basic indicator. </p>
						<p>The statements are: 
						
						
				<p><li>I struggle to sleep at night.			  
						<li>I struggle to concentrate in class.
						<li>I struggle to concentrate in class. 
						<li>I often get aches and pains in my muscles.
						<li>I often struggle to remember things from lessons. 
						<li>I often feel irritable. 
						<li>I often feel unmotivated. 
						<li>I often feel anxious. 
						
						
						
						
						
						<p>If you find that you are agreeing with several of these statements, then it is a sign that you may be suffering from stress. If so then below are some tips on how to handle stress. If you disagreed with all of these then the tips below are still worth a read as they may still improve your overall mental wellbeing. </p></p>
						
						
			
						
						
						
						
						
						
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Tips to deal with stress</button>
			<div class="content2">
			  <p><li>Take a break – make sure that several times a week you take some time for yourself and do something that you enjoy.</li>
							<li>Be active – I am not suggesting go for a long run but ensure that you get outside once a day. Just going for a gentle walk will allow your mind to relax and ease itself.</li>
							<li>Sleep tight – An adult	needs on average 6-8 hours’ sleep per night. It is important to give your body a chance to rest and unwind from the day. A good way to work this out is to work backwards. If you need to get up at 07:00 in the morning the count backwards. You could aim to be asleep by 11:00 so try and turn out your light at 10:30.</li>
							<li>Be positive – If you look for negatives then you are more likely to find negatives. Instead try to identify the positives in a situation and focus on them.</li>
							<li>If you can’t change it then don’t stress about it – In our daily lives, we will come across minor stresses that we have no control over at all. If you encounter one of these try and take a deep breath and move on.</li>
						</ol>
						<p> As a bonus tip – If the stress that you are feeling is more extreme or is causing you trouble sleeping at night then it may be an idea to try meditating. This allows your mind and body to relax more deeply and can also help us to fall asleep.</p>

			<p> <font size="+2">Depression</font> </p>
			
			
			<button class="collapsible">Depression</button>
			<div class="content2">
			  <p>Many people go through brief times where they feel a bit down. This is normal behaviour and not to be confused with depression. Depressed people feel feelings of sadness that last for weeks or months. Depression is a very serious illness and If you believe that you are suffering then it is highly recommended that you see a GP for diagnosis and treatment. With treatment people can often make a full recovery from depression. There are different levels of depression defined by how severe it is: Mild depression has a minor impact on daily life, Moderate depression has a more significant impact on daily life, Severe depression makes it nearly impossible to get through daily life. </p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">How to identify depression</button>
			<div class="content2">
			  <p>Below are some common symptoms of depression. You can work your way down the list and see how many of the statements below you agree with. <br> </p>	
			  <p><li>I have a consistently low mood</li>
							<li>I often feel hopeless and helpless</li>
							<li>I have low self esteem</li>
							<li>I often feel guilty</li>
							<li>I have little motivation</li>
							<li>I do not enjoy life</li>
							<li>I have little energy</li>
							<li>I have unexplained aches and pains </li>
							<li>I avoid taking part in social activities </li>
						</ol>
						<p> If you find that you are agreeing with many of these statements, then it may be a good idea to check with your GP. 
			  
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Tips to treat depression</button>
			<div class="content2">			  
			  <p><li>Give it time – Wait to see if the symptoms go away by itself. If the symptoms have only recently appeared, then it may be an idea to leave it for two weeks and see if the symptoms persist. This may not however be a good idea if the symptoms appeared months ago. </li>
							<li>Exercise – Studies have shown that by exercising can help to relieve the symptoms of depression. Exercise causes the brain to have more positive chemistry which makes us happier.</li>
							<li>Self-help – Another idea is to talk to close friends and family about your feelings. You could also talk to your GP or a local psychological therapy service if you prefer. </li>
							<li>Sleep tight – ensure that you are getting a solid 8 hours of sleep per night. This can be helped by turning off devices at least an hour before you plan on sleeping. Also set yourself a bedtime, while it sounds childish it will help to let your body get in to a good sleeping cycle. Also try and remove distractions from your room. </li>
							<li>Try something new – If you are depressed then trying something new may help. New things can alter brain chemistry and possibly help to relieve the symptoms and you may find something new that you enjoy. </li>
							<li>Challenge negative thoughts – People who suffer with depression tend to jump to and focus on the negative thoughts. By using logic and reasoning we can debunk these irrational and sad thoughts and replace them with more rational and happier ones. </li><br>

			<button class="collapsible">Anxiety</button>
			<div class="content2">
			  <p>Anxiety is a feeling of worry or fear that varies in severity. Feeling anxiety is natural in certain situations for example having a job interview or taking an exam. This is completely normal! Some people however struggle to control these emotions and feel them much more than others and in more of an intense way. Anxiety is a common condition, estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">How to identify anxiety</button>

			<button class="collapsible">Tips to treat anxiety</button>
			<div class="content2">
			  <p>Tips to deal with anxiety</p>
			  <p><li>Reduce caffeine – Caffeine causes the body to be very stimulated. This can make existing anxiety even worse 
					<li>Exercise – Regular exercise reduces anxiety levels overtime whereas an intense session of exercise can get rid of symptoms for several hours. 
					<li>Don’t drink or smoke – If you smoke or drink a fair amount it has been shown to make anxiety worse so quitting smoking and reducing the amount of alcohol that you drink may help
					<li>Self-help course – There are many courses out there that are designed to reduce the amount of anxiety that you feel down to more manageable levels 
					<li>Support groups – There are also several support groups out there that have been created to talk about problems with you. This can help to reduce symptoms. Links to these will be below
				</ol>
				<p>These tips may help to reduce symptoms but if the case it more serious then it is recommended that you go and see your GP. Your GP can sort out some psychological treatment for you and that will be more helpful for more severe cases than the tips above.</p>
